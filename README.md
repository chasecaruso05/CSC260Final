## Our Project

Two parts: the calendar and note taker.

## Calendar

Click a specific day to add an event

- See a day's events by clicking `No`
- Add more events by clicking `Yes`

All days with events scheduled will be marked in orange on the calendar

> Events stored in an arraylist, bound inside individual hash map elements for each day.
> Arraylist allows for multiple events in one day
> Hashmap allows for easy storage and lookup by a day's epoch number

## Note Taker

Allows simple storage of non date dependant tasks.
